              <h3>Welcome to Streampost</h3>
              <p>
                Streampost is a lightweight blogging platform designed for the user who wants
                to blog without the 'riff-raff'. Complicated themes, templates, overwhelming file systems,
                and too many 'features' that don't work for the blogger who just wants to write
                are the reasons for the development of Streampost
              </p>
              <h4>What is Streampost?</h4>
              <p>
                Streampost is a PHP application that interacts with a MySQL database to deliver content
                to an HTML document. The best way to think of Streampost is to imagine a runner that
                gets content from one place and delivers it to another. The MySQL database houses the content
                wrappers (header, footer, sidebar, and other meta content), posts, and user information. Streampost
                retrieves that content and delivers it to the browser in HTML markup. Users can log in to the system
                to take HTML content and deliver it to the database.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='section scrollspy doc-sect' id='getting-started'>
              <h3>Getting Started</h3>
              <p>
                To get started with Streampost, you'll need a few things:<br>
                <ul>
                  <li>A Domain Name or Local Virtual Server</li>
                  <li>A Server (or Local Virtual Server) with MySQL, PHP, the ability to edit and add databases, and CPanel access.</li>
                  <li>A good understanding of how a website works</li>
                  <li>A scratchpad to remember a few things when setting up Streampost</li>
                </ul><br>
                Once you have these things, setting up Streampost is a breeze!
              </p>
              <h4>Installing Streampost</h4>
              <p>To install Streampost on your server, download the .zip file from <a href='#'>here</a>. After
                downloading, sign into CPanel and select the directory where you want Streampost installed.
                Remember this location, it will come in handy later. <br>
                In CPanel, open File Manager and navigate to the directory you chose. Upload the .zip file by
                pressing 'Upload' in the top menu. To unpack a file, click 'Extract' in the menu at the top of
                the file manager screen. A new folder titled 'Streampost' should appear. Select the files in the
                folder and move them up one level by double clicking the folder, pressing the 'Select All'
                option, and clicking 'move'. In the dialog, select the parent directory where you want Streampost
                to operate.
              </p>
              <h4>Creating the Database</h4>
              <p>Since Streampost works on a database, a database, user, and password will need to be created.
                To do this, in CPanel, navigate to the MySQL Database Wizard. Create a new database with
                whatever name you like, but be sure to remember the name. Click 'next step'. Enter a username,
                password, and confirm the password. Click 'next step'. Check 'all priveleges' on the next
                page, then click 'next step'. You've created a database!
              </p>
              <h4>Running the Install Script</h4>
              <p>The install script is the most crucial part of installing Streampost. To get started on the
                final step, navigate to <a href='setup.html'>yourstreampostinstall.com/setup.html</a>. Fill out
                the form with the correct information, click on 'Submit', and your Streampost blog is now
                finished installing! Congratulations! But your posts are not populated, so all you'll see is
                the 'Welcome' post and static items, such as the header, sidebar, and footer. To populate
                your blog, check out <a href='#post'>Creating a Post</a>.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='section scrollspy doc-sect' id='setup-problems'>
              <h3>Something isn't working</h3>
              <p>If you're having trouble installing, make sure you're entering the correct information in the
                following spots</p>
              <h4>Your Domain URL:</h4>
              <p>
                The URL of your domain should not include 'http://'. While entering joesblog.com will work,
                entering http://joesblog.com will not. <br>
                Similarly, the <i>www.</i> is not necessary. When entering your blog URL, make sure to enter
                the full url, including any subdirectories where your Streampost install exists. If you want
                your blog hosted on joesblog.com in the subdirectory <i>blog</i>, the blog URL will be
                joesblog.com/blog.
              </p>
              <h4>Host URL</h4>
              <p>
                Your Host URL will probably be localhost - if it's not, an error will occur when loading
                'index.php' (the front page of your blog) that says 'Err: Host not resolved' or something
                similar. If you recieve this error, log in to CPanel and look at the stats on the left hand side
                of the page. Your host name should be listed there. Alternatively, call your hosting provider
                to make sure you're entering the correct information.
              </p>
              <h4>Database Name, Username, and Password</h4>
              <p>
                Entering an incorrect database name will cause Streampost to fail. To obtain the full database
                name, login to PHPMyAdmin then select the database you want Streampost to work with. At the top
                of the page, your full database name will be listed; and, will look something like
                <i>'root_streampost'</i>.<br>
                Similarly, the database username will be prefixed. The database's username will have the same
                prefix, i.e. <i>'root_admin'</i>.
                <br>The password must be entered exactly how it was entered when creating the database.
                This is where the scratchpad comes in handy.</p>
            </div>
            <div class='section scrollspy doc-sect' id='control-center'>
              <h3>Making a Post</h3>
              <p>
                So, you've completed your Streampost install and you're ready to start posting. Great!<br>
                To start a post, you must first log-in. Go to your
                <a href='admin/login.html' target='_blank'>Login</a> page to login, and you'll be brought to the
                Control Center. Here, you can perform all of the administrative functions to your blog. <br>
              </p>
              <h4>Control Center Overview</h4>
              <p>
                The control center provides options to update and view posts, edit the sidebar, footer, title,
                and contact email, and options for user administration. These options appear in the left sidebar
                navigation menu on desktop, and in the expandable left navigation menu on mobile.
              </p>
              <ol>
                <li><a href='#post'>Posting</a></li>
                <li><a href='#cc-content'>Editing Static Content</a></li>
                <li><a href='#cc-user-admin'>User Administration</a></li>
              </ol>
            </div>
            <div class='section scrollspy doc-sect' id='post'>
              <h3>Posts</h3>
              <p>
                A listing of your posts will appear on the front page of the control center with an option to
                update the posts. Additionally, the post can be viewed by clicking the post title.
              </p>
              <h4>Creating a post</h4>
              <p>
                To create a new post, you have a few options. From the front page of the control center, click
                'New Post' in the left navigation menu. This will bring up the 'new post' form. Additionally,
                clicking 'post editor' in the left navigation menu will pull up a list of all posts with
                options to update and delete each individual post. In the top right corner of the page is a
                circle with a '+' in it. Clicking this button will bring you to the new post page. <br>
                Once you've arrived at the new post page, a form with title and content fields appears. Fill
                out the title and content, and press 'post' to confirm your post.
              </p>
              <h4>Post Preview</h4>
              <p>
                Post Preview allows the user to preview a post before saving it. This is useful when using
                HTML in a post. It is important to know what a post preview does not save the post. To preview
                a post, follow the above instructions, but instead of pressing 'post', press 'preview'. This will
                open a new tab or window with your post's content. In the right sidebar, an option to submit the
                post will appear. After changing the post content on the new post page, a new instance of the
                post preview must be initiated and the changes won't apply to the previous preview.
              </p>
              <h4>Editing A Post</h4>
              <p>
                To edit a post, navigate to 'post editor' in the left navigation menu or click on 'update' in the
                front page of the control center in the 'posts' section. This pulls up the same form as the 'new
                post' page, but it is pre-filled with the post's content. From here, updating a post is the same
                as creating a new post.
              </p>
              <h4>Deleting a Post</h4>
              <p>
                To delete a post, navigate to 'post editor' in the left navigation menu. Each post will appear
                in the page and a button to delete the post appears on each post. Clicking the 'delete' button
                will force a prompt to appear that asks the user to confirm the post deletion. If you select '
                yes, I want to delete this post', you will be taken to a confirmation page. If no, the prompt will
                disapppear and the post will not be deleted.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='section scrollspy doc-sect' id='html'>
              <h3>HTML In Posts</h3>
              <p>
                Posts allow HTML markup. To create a header, wrap your header text in the &lt;h2&gt; &amp;
                &lt;/h2&gt; tags, like this:<br>
                <span class='code'>&lt;h2&gt;This is my header&lt;/h2&gt;</span><br>
                This will output the following line:
              </p>
              <h2>This is my header</h2>
              <p>
                Paragraph tags are &lt;p&gt; &amp; &lt;/p&gt;. Paragraphs can format text. Wrapping words or
                phrases in the &lt;i&gt; &amp; &lt;/i&gt; tags will make the text <i>italic</i>. Likewise,
                &lt;strong&gt; &amp; &lt;/strong&gt; tags will make your text <strong>bold</strong>.<br>
                Images can be embedded by using the &lt;img /&gt; tags. Image tags have certain <i>attributes</i>,
                which include, at a minimum, a 'src' and 'alt'. Width and Height are also appropriate sometimes.
                The 'src' attribute defines the location of the image to be embedded, or the URL of an image.
                The 'alt' attribute defines the descriptive text that accompanies the image that appears when a
                user hovers over an image. The width and height do exactly what they sound like: width defines
                the image's width and height defines the images height. An embedded image would look like this:
                <br>
                <span class='code'>&lt;img src='https://g.twimg.com/Twitter_logo_blue.png' alt='Follow me on Twitter!' width='50px' height='50px'/&gt;</span>
                <br>
                Anchor tags are also available for use, which most people know as <i>hyperlinks</i> or just
                <i>links</i>. Text can be wrapped in an anchor tag with the &lt;a&gt; &amp; &lt;/a&gt; tags.
                Anchor tags have two major attributes: the <i>href</i> and <i>target</i>. The href is the URL
                being linked to. The target attribute defines where to load the link. For Streampost, all you need
                to know is that setting the target to _blank will open it in a new tab. This is what an anchor tag
                looks like:<br>
                <span class='code'>&lt;a href='https://example.com' target='_blank'&gt;Example!&lt;/a&gt;</span>
                This will output: <a href='https://example.com' target='_blank'>Example!</a><br>
                Combining tags might be a good idea. For example: to link to a photographer's page, wrap one of
                their images in an anchor tag with the href set to their URL. When that image is clicked, the
                user will be taken to their website.
              </p>
            </div>
            <div class='section scrollspy doc-sect' id='cc-content'>
              <h3>Editing Content</h3>
              <p>
                To edit your site content, login to the Control Center and you'll see right on the landing
                screen the ability to edit the Blog Title and Contact Email. Editing the content inside and
                pressing 'submit' will update that value. To edit the sidebar, click 'sidebar editor' in the
                left navigation menu. The screen that appears will contain a form to update your sidebar content.
                To edit the footer, click 'footer editor' in the left navigation menu. The screen that appears
                will contain a form to update your footer content. These two forms are similar to the post
                editor.
              </p>

            <div class='section scrollspy doc-sect' id='cc-user-admin'>
              <h3>Logging In and Out</h3>
              <p>
                Logging in to Streampost allows a user control center access. To login, go to the
                <a href='admin/login.html' target='_blank'>Login</a> page and enter your username and password.
                Click 'Login' to access your control center, and you're all set to go!
              </p>
              <h4>Logging Out</h4>
              <p>
                To log out, click the button in the top-right corner of any page. This will end the current
                session and return you to the blog's homepage.
              </p>
              <h4>Sessions</h4>
              <p>
                Sessions will last as long as 1 hour. After this point, you will have to login again.<br>
                This feature exists for security purposes and can not be disabled or edited, unless you're
                a programmer and know how to change these things, but we suggest you don't.
              </p>
              <h4>Forgotten Password</h4>
              <p>
                If you forget your password or username, click the 'Forgot Credentials' on the login page.
                You will be asked to fill out a form with, and, if Streampost has your username or email on
                file, you will be emailed a password reset link. This link is a single-use, limited-time link,
                and must be completed within 10 minutes to ensure a successful password reset. Again, this
                practice exists for security purposes and can not be disabled or edited, unless you're a programmer
                and know how to change these things, but, again, we suggest you don't.
              </p>
              <h4>User Administration</h4>
              <p>
                Streampost allows multiple users. To add a user, navigate to 'user administration' in the left
                navigation menu. A page with a listing of all users will appear, with an option to edit each
                user. In the top right corner, a round button with a '+' inside will appear. Clicking this
                button will bring you to the new user form. Completing the form will add in a user and email
                the entered email address with their information. <br>
                To delete or edit a user, navigate to 'user administration' in the left navigation menu. A page with
                a listing of all users will appear, with an option to edit each user. Click on the 'edit' button
                to bring up the user-edit form. Modifying any field here will change the information, and clicking
                'delete' will delete the user.

              <p>
                We like to believe that we do a good job securing things; however, new exploits are discovered
                daily and no web based application such as Streampost is ever 100% secure. Because of this,
                we encourage three easy practices to ensure data protection:<br>
