Streampost is a lightweight blogging solution for the person who just wants to write. The focus is on content rather than customization (though limited customization is possible).
### Main Features
**Individual posts** - you can visit an individual post by clicking on the post's title on the home page.   
**Multiple Users** - You can add users from the User Administration Tab in the Control Center  
**Mobile Optimized** - Streampost was built on [Materialize CSS](http://materializecss.com), which means that it scales well and looks the same no matter the device.   
**Dead Simple** - Editing content, making posts, and administrative functions are easy to understand and well documented.

### Documentation
All documentation found here can also be found in the documentation, which will be at http://your_streampost_install.com/docs.html

### Installation
To install Streampost, you need a few things:
1. A domain name or local virtual server
2. A Server (or Local Virtual Server) with MySQL, PHP, the ability to edit and add databases, and CPanel access.
3. A good understanding of how a website works
4. A Notepad to remember a few things when setting up Streampost

To install Streampost, you can download this repo and then upload it to the location where you want to use Streampost. Be sure to note your installation location (good place to use the scratchpad)

A MySQL database needs to be created. Be sure to note the database username, password, name, and host.

Running the install script is as easy as navigating to http://your_streampost_install.com/setup.html and completing the setup form.

Once Streampost is installed and the setup script has finished, you'll be redirected to the home page (index.php). From there, you can log in to the control center, where you can make a new post, edit your information, create and remove users, and view your blog.
